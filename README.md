# quicApp
Capstone Project


**Release notes:**
What features were included in this final release, what known bugs exist, and any additional information.
The latest version of Quic offers realtime display of user information. Previously, dummy data was used for the social media list on the dashboard. Similarly, real user information was only updated after the user logged out and then back in. Now, the app works entirely with realtime data; when a social media is added or deleted, everything is updated accordingly. Any changes in the database are automatically reflected on the app. It also offers the add social medias page, which automatically adds it to the database and reflects it on the dashboard. Similarly, the option to edit personal information is added too, where users can change their email, name, and bio. Once more, this is reflected automatically both in the database and dashboard. There are no known bugs.
